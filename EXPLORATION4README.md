===============
This time around I chose to explore Python. This language I have been hearing about a lot lately. This language is completely new to me. I found some pretty good documentation this time around. One obstacle I had was the tutorial I used was really big on whitespace and really strict on the code you input. There were a couple times where I remember getting stuck and having to check out the Q&A form and read up on more documentation. Once again I am sold! I really like this language it might end up becoming my favorite later on down the road. This is going to be the first exploration that I will expand on simply because I found myself doing the tutorial for fun like in my spare time. Also I saw that the WePay API is compatible with python so I might have to check that out as well.
