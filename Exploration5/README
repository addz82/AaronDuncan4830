This time around I chose to explore Ruby and create a Rails Application. This language much like python, I have also heard about a lot lately. This language is also completely new to me so I read up on some documentation. One obstacle I had was the tutorial I used was with methods. If I got stuck I referred to either the documentation or the Q&A form. Once again I was overall pleased. I found myself doing more and more exploring each week. This week was no exception I really tried to dig into this on my first time. I really like this language between ruby and python they are my two my favorites. I plan on expanding on this project even if we run out of explorations.
